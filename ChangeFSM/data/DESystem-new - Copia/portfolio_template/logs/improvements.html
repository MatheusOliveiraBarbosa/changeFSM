    should update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have
    for improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs
    in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the
    project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new
    features for the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or
    issues for a particular project, add an entry that says "no
    suggestions" or something similar.<br>
    <br>
    Project 1<br>
    <ul>
      <li>I hope I could have more explanations about the entries in the
        .stats file, so I can get a better understanding of what it
        says. </li>
      <li>The elevator has been made to stop at every floor even though
        there were no passengers in the elevator and there were no hall
        calls on any other floors. A simulation time of&nbsp; 500
        seconds was required for the passenger to be delieverd which is
        very high considering he was the only passenger.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 2<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a basic page of instructions for toolkit like DIA and
        git.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 3<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The time triggered behaviors don't seem to cover all the
        cases, for eg. when a door reversal occurs, we have to stop door
        and then open it, it is mentioned in the constraint but it is
        not in the requirement making the traceability for that
        requirement hard. - skoppaka</li>
      <li>No suggestions - ststeven,yuechen,jnie</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 4<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>mHallCall,mCarCall is traced to future expansion because it is
        not an input to any controller or object. Therefore&nbsp;
        suggest we remove those messages now or we add some modules to
        utilize it - skoppaka</li>

    <p>Project 7<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In Sample performance monitor summary, String arr =&nbsp; new
        String[0], it has to be new String[1] or else we get
        ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception. - skoppaka</li>

          the acceptance test says that the passenger hasn't exited
          successfully even though they have - yuechen, skoppaka<br>

      <p><big><b>Overall Project Comments</b></big><br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It would be great if there were scripts for checking
          submissions in order to make sure we don't miss anything while
          submitting every project.</li>
        <li>It would be better if not as many points were allocated to
          editing and submission checks.<br>
        </li>
        <li>We really liked that design part of the course which takes
          us through industry level design process of any embedded
          project.<br>
